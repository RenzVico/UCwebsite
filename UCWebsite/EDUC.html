      <h3>College of Teacher Education</h3>
      <p>When the University of the Cordilleras (then Baguio Colleges) opened its doors on June 19, 1946 to 154 students, the College of Education started with the curriculum of Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) with 25 students and 19 females for Elementary Teachers Certificate (ETC). From this batch, successful superintendents, supervisors and deans who currently lead the provincial and city schoolsâ€™ offices emerged, not to mention the score of teachers in both private and public schools.

In 1958, after 12 years of offering the ETC course, the curriculum of Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEED) was created.

Following the first decade of service, additional course offerings were implemented, namely: Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEED), Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE), and Bachelor of Science in Home Economics (BSHE).

Baguio Colleges Foundation was granted Government Recognition No. 119, Series of 1950 for a FOUR-YEAR EDUCATION PROGRAM which empowered it to grant a degree of Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Government Recognition No. 280, Series of 1958 for the FOUR-YEAR COLLEGIATE NORMAL COLLEGE which further empowered it to grant the degree Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEED).

On September 7, 2007, the College has been identified by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Teacher Education Council (TEC) as Center of Training Institution (COT) to serve as service provider for DepEd Certificate and other In-Service Training Programs.

On November 5, 2010, the College of Teacher Education was awarded by CHED as Center of Excellence for Teacher Education (COE), by virtue of Resolution 257- 2010 approved by the Commission en banc.

In 2015, the College of Education, now known as the College of Teacher Education, was awarded Level III Re-Accreditation by the Philippine Accrediting Association for Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU).

On August 2, 2018, the College has been awarded Certificate of Recognition for having its curriculum reviewed through the Outcomes-based Pre-service Teacher Education Program: Curriculum Quality Audit, by the Research Center for Teacher Quality (RCTQ), Philippine Normal University (PNU), University of New England (UNE), and SiMERR National Research Center.</p>
